Sketch out the course pages


Create a object {wk1{vid1: {title: tonato, description: aotsn, link: raston...}}}
Use a for loop to create the video containers, adding data-week attribute to indicate the week it belongs to
Hook up wk buttons to corresponding videos, show/hide videos on click
    - Do with css for now, although could dynamically generate on request will      reload page, so only do that if we convert the site to react


Build data structure that contains:
- video link
- video title
- amount watched by user
- description
Dynamically generate
 -video in the continue watching
 -videos in the quick view


Add checkpoints
Add logic to show only some wks at a time
Dynamically generate passed modules

Reduce base font size
Style lines between the wk button pressed and its videos
Style dotted lines between the wk buttons
